HAnimAnimation chunk header (0x1B)
	RwInt32                     0x100
	RwInt32                     interpolation type id (1 = RpHAnimStd)
	RwInt32                     numFrames
	RwInt32                     flags
	RwReal                      duration
	numFrames*sizeof(keyFrame)  key frames

serialized format of RpHAnimStdKeyFrame:
	RwReal      time
	RtQuat      q     // quaternion describing rotation
	RwV3d       t     // position
	RwInt32     prev  // should be offset of previous key frame from beginning of frame data but appears to be junk

PS2 .ska (skeletal animation) are almost the same format.
They have no chunk header nor the first two ints (so a file starts at numFrames directly).
In key frames the time comes after t, not before q.
